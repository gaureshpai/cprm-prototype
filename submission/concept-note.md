# CPRM - Centralized Patient & Resource Management System
## Smart Display System for Wenlock Hospital

### 🎯 **Problem Statement Analysis**

**Wenlock Hospital Challenge**: 73 display screens across departments (Cardiology, OT, Pharmacy) operate in isolation with no unified platform for real-time updates, emergency alerts, or synchronized data display.

**Core Issues Identified**:
- **Fragmented Display Management**: 73 screens showing disconnected information
- **No Real-time Synchronization**: OT schedules and pharmacy inventory operate independently  
- **Emergency Alert Gaps**: No unified system for Code Blue/Red broadcasts
- **Department Silos**: Cardiology, OT, and Pharmacy lack integrated communication
- **Patient Privacy Concerns**: Full patient names displayed on public screens

### 🏥 **Key Features Implemented**

#### **A. Smart Display System**
##### **Public Patient Displays**
- **Token-Based Queues**: Shows "P001", "P002" instead of full names
- **Wait Time Estimates**: Real-time queue progression
- **Department Status**: "OT-1 Ready", "Cardiology Queue: 3"
- **Emergency Overlays**: Code alerts override normal content

##### **Staff Internal Displays**  
- **Detailed Schedules**: Complete OT timetables with surgeon assignments
- **Inventory Alerts**: "Morphine: Low Stock - 12 units remaining"
- **Emergency Protocols**: Detailed response procedures for Code Blue/Red

#### **B. Department Synchronization**

##### **OT + Pharmacy Integration**
```typescript
// Real-time sync example
OT Schedule Update → Pharmacy Alert
"Surgery at 2 PM" → "Prepare anesthesia medications"
"Emergency Surgery" → "Priority drug allocation"
```

##### **Cardiology + OT Coordination**
- Pre-surgery cardiac assessments sync with OT scheduling
- Post-surgery monitoring alerts to cardiology team
- Shared patient status updates across departments

#### **C. Emergency Alert System**
##### **Code Blue (Cardiac Emergency)**
- **Instant Broadcast**: All 73 displays show alert within 5 seconds
- **Location Specific**: "Code Blue - OT-3, Cardiology Team Required"
- **Response Tracking**: Staff acknowledgment and ETA display
- **Auto-Clear**: Alerts resolve when emergency ends

##### **Code Red (Fire Emergency)**
- **Evacuation Routes**: Dynamic display based on fire location
- **Department Status**: "OT-2 Evacuating, Patients to Safe Zone"
- **Resource Allocation**: Available wheelchairs, stretchers, staff

### 🔄 **Real-Time Data Flow Simulation**

#### **Scenario 1: Emergency Surgery**
```
1. Emergency patient arrives → Token P156 generated
2. OT-2 cleared for emergency → Display updates across hospital
3. Pharmacy alerted → Critical medications prepared
4. Cardiology notified → Cardiac team on standby
5. All displays show → "Emergency in Progress - OT-2"
```

#### **Scenario 2: Drug Inventory Alert**
```
1. Morphine stock drops to 10 units → System alert triggered
2. OT displays show → "Morphine Low - Limit non-critical use"
3. Pharmacy display → "URGENT: Reorder Morphine - Current: 10"
4. Admin dashboard → "Critical Stock Alert - Action Required"
```

#### **Scenario 3: Code Blue Response**
```
1. Code Blue triggered in Cardiology → All displays alert
2. OT team sees → "Code Blue - Cardiology Ward 3A"
3. Available staff → "Respond if available - ETA 2 min"
4. Equipment tracking → "Defibrillator dispatched to Ward 3A"
```
