- Title:
`CPRM - Centralized Patient-Resource Mgmt System`

- Description Of Project (How does it solves the problem?): 
`In order to remedy the concerns, my system is a total, privacy-oriented hospital display management system. 
It maintains patient privacy through token-based queues (e.g., "001, 002" rather than full names) and showing only initials (e.g., "R.K."). 
Sensitive departments are given extra privacy measures. 
The system also includes an actual-time emergency alert system, including Code Blue for full-screen immediate alerts on all displays. 
Automated responses activate pre-programmed processes, with multi-level alerts (Critical, High, Medium) to ensure proper response. 
Beyond privacy and emergencies, the system enhances hospital operations with live queue management, real-time patient flow tracking, and department status updates (bed availability, staff allocation, equipment status). 
It provides drug inventory alerts and operating theater scheduling, streamlining workflows. 
Built with a modular architecture, it supports API-first integration with existing systems, compatibility with major display managers (LG), and any hospital database. 
Scalable across 100+ displays in multiple buildings, it ensures seamless, efficient, and secure hospital-wide management.

The website has role based access where the different roles are: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Technician, Pharmacist
*Being a Frontend developer, my solution is more frontend specific/focused*
you can login with the demo credentials given in the login page 
For Admin: Dashboard - Create Update Read Delete emergency alerts, announcements, manage displays, Users, check analytics
For Doctor: Dashboard - Create  Update Read Delete Prescription, Patient users, OT status
For Nurse:  Dashboard - Create  Update Read Delete and monitor Patient data, Ward management, Prescriptions
For Technician:  Dashboard - Create  Update Read Delete displays and configure them
For Pharmacist:  Dashboard - Create  Update Read Delete Purchase order, manage drug inventory
For all users: profile and settings that reflect the overall system, auth guard and privacy across roles
The displays are focused on auto fetch real time data for every 5 seconds and not web socket to avoid dependency on any particular systems (Displays to be on even if there is no Admin active) also have used display/{id} that can be either auto generated or customized and allotted particular screens as mixed screen/drug inventory/token queue 

Tech stack used:
Nextjs, Prisma OMR, Neon Postgres SQL, Shadcn UI components library, Tailwindcss,
